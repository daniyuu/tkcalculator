#A simple Tkinter based Calculator

##Introduction

It can be used to show how to build test automation. Basically you can use it to:

1. It's buggy so you can use it to train new testers to design test cases;
2. UI automation test tools(Sikuli) is used in this project;
3. This project illustrates how a good design (using CalBus to separate the UI layer and the logic layer) helps improving test automation.

If you found it useful or like to contribute, pls let me know:)

##How to launch application
run command:
`python main.py`

##How to launch UI automation
1. Install Sikuli (I used Sikuli 1.1.0 nightly build, which can be downloaded from sikuli.org)
2. Run command:
`[PATH_TO_SIKULI]/runsikulix -r [PATH_TO_CODE]/UIAutomation/testUI.sikuli`

TODO:
1. Create full coverage tests (unit tests)
